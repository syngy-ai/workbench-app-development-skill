# Workbench App Development

## Core contract

Use only the official Workbench React scaffold and `octopus-cli` for creation/deployment. Every app keeps `@syngy/workbench-auth`; optional features are business clients, never authentication switches.

Inspect repository instructions and target first. Never scaffold a non-empty app. For existing apps, inspect `package.json` and the facade, infer features, preserve custom/uncommitted work, and add only a required official client using its package manager and current official contract.

| Requirement | Feature |
| --- | --- |
| Authenticated Workbench UI only | empty |
| Host users, teams, members, organization, digital employees, conversations, files, knowledge, skills, integrations, or runtime resources | `octopus` |
| Tasks or projects | `taskboard` |
| Persisted, shared, queryable records | `arcubase` |

Local TypeScript objects and static fixtures do not imply Arcubase.
When `octopus` is selected, read the [Octopus client contract](references/octopus-client.md) before installing or calling Host APIs. Displaying only the authenticated viewer does not require it.

## Arcubase decision

When Arcubase is required, stop before writes: the developer explicitly chooses an existing or new App.

- Existing: list Apps; require an explicit ID when candidates are ambiguous; inspect schema and stable keys; generate typed project code.
- New: present tables, fields, relations, and access model. Create through `octopus-cli arcubase-admin` only after that choice, then generate typed code.

Never guess an ID, match by name alone, or silently create storage.
Before writing datetime row values or defining `serialnumber` fields, read [Arcubase runtime gotchas](references/arcubase-runtime-gotchas.md).
Even when `octopus.api` exposes Arcubase proxy methods, persisted business data uses the `arcubase` feature and its generated typed ingress clients.

## Workflow

Read [command contracts](references/command-contracts.md) before scaffolding, Arcubase work, or deployment.

1. Scaffold a safe empty target or inspect the existing app.
2. Before team-scoped discovery (including Arcubase App list) and every external write, run `octopus-cli auth whoami --json`; verify profile, host, account, and team. On mismatch, stop with a copyable correction.
3. Use the generated authenticated facade; do not add a token store or standalone login. Generate typed clients for selected backend features and implement only working visible controls.
4. Follow the [local validation contract](references/local-validation.md) before any production build or remote project creation: start the declared dev server, connect through the supported local Workbench login, and prove the selected real backend supplies the rendered business state.
5. Report the local URL, verified context, selected feature/App IDs, evidence, and unresolved issues. Stop until the developer explicitly approves publishing. An earlier request to deploy does not waive this checkpoint; skip it only when the developer explicitly waives interactive local acceptance.
6. After approval, run only declared relevant tests and the production build; require `dist/index.html`.
7. Create at most one first remote Workbench project, and only after the accepted build. If its response is uncertain, use `coding projects list/show` to resolve it before any retry. Never introduce or write a hidden local project-ID mapping file. Later deployments use an explicit project ID or an unambiguous exact list result.
8. Publish the built directory and boundedly watch its task: `queued`/`processing` continue; `failed` stops immediately with `errorMessage` and action; `active` plus `workbenchUrl` succeeds. Successful handoff reports exactly `projectId`, `taskId`, `status=active`, `workbenchUrl`, verified `profile`, `host`, `team`; never substitute Arcubase `appId` or deployment/version/environment fields.

Direct HTTP, `kubectl`, GitHub Actions, copied scaffold, alternate publish, and remote archive/delete are outside this skill.

Every stop or failure must state the proven reason and a directly copyable next action. For an unsupported CLI flag, run that exact command’s current `--help`; never try legacy or guessed aliases.

## Skill improvement

Change this skill only when explicitly requested. Read [acceptance scenarios](references/acceptance-scenarios.md), reproduce the concrete gap before editing, make the smallest correction, validate it, and rerun the failing and affected scenarios. Do not add speculative compatibility or a changelog.
